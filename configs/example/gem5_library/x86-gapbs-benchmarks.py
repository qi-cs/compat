"""
Script to run GAPBS benchmarks with gem5. The script expects the user to
provide the benchmark to run.
The system is fixed with 2 CPU cores, MESI Two Level system cache and 3 GiB
DDR4 memory. It uses the x86 board.

This script will count the total number of instructions executed
in the ROI. It also tracks how much wallclock and simulated time.

Usage:
------

```
scons build/ALL/gem5.opt
./build/ALL/gem5.opt \
    configs/example/gem5_library/x86-gabps-benchmarks.py \
    --benchmark <benchmark_name>
```
